# WebdesignFinal
This was my final submission for my WebDesign I class.

At the time, I did not think this was that good looking, but now I actually quite like it. I made this last second because college, but it demonstrates a variety of concepts I learned in the intro class. If anything, the .js files for the cart show how time constrained I was since I just copy-pasta!
